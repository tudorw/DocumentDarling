# DocumentDarling
**An idea born of neccesity for the EXAR-Wellbeing journey! https://exar-wellbeing.org.uk/**



DocumentDarling, aims to revolutionize document creation and maintenance for organizations by leveraging AI technology to streamline the process of drafting and updating legal, regulatory, safeguarding, and other crucial forms and documents. By incorporating a human-in-the-loop approach, DocumentDarling, ensures the quality and compliance of the final documents while minimizing the time and effort required by human experts.

Establish partnerships with legal and regulatory experts to ensure compliance with industry standards.
Promote DocumentDarling, through marketing campaigns targeting organizations in need of document management solutions.
Continuously improve the system by incorporating user feedback and updating the AI to account for evolving legal, regulatory, and safeguarding requirements.

The idea was born of need for a system like this before we embarked on the EXAR-Wellbeing journey! 
https://exar-wellbeing.org.uk/

Next Steps, a technical roadmap
Define project scope and requirements: Begin by clearly defining the project scope, including the specific features and functionalities of the prototype. List down the requirements and prioritize them based on their importance and feasibility.

Research libraries and APIs: Investigate existing Python libraries, APIs, and tools that can be utilized to facilitate document parsing, analysis, and natural language processing, such as SpaCy, NLTK, Gensim, and the OpenAI API.

Set up a version control system: Establish a version control system, like Git, to manage your codebase and track changes throughout the development process. This will make collaboration easier and ensure a smooth workflow.

Create a development environment: Set up a dedicated development environment with the required tools, libraries, and dependencies. This may include an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, and package management tools like pip or conda.

Develop the AI-powered document analysis component: Begin by implementing the functionality to parse and analyze documents, extracting relevant information and identifying areas of improvement. Use NLP techniques to understand the content, and train your model to suggest updates based on legal, regulatory, and safeguarding requirements.

Implement guided document creation: Create templates and guidelines for new documents, and develop a user interface that helps users navigate the document creation process. Integrate AI suggestions to ensure consistency and compliance with the master communications policy.

Build document organization assistance: Develop a system to categorize and store documents based on their content. Implement algorithms to help users find and manage essential records more efficiently.

Develop tone and content approval functionality: Implement a module to check the tone and content of documents against the organization's master communications policy. Train your AI model to recognize and suggest improvements in adherence to the policy.

Integrate human-in-the-loop oversight: Design a user interface that presents AI-suggested changes to human reviewers, allowing them to approve or modify suggestions as needed. Implement a mechanism for human sign-off on completed documents.

Test and iterate: Perform thorough testing of the prototype, focusing on usability, accuracy, and performance. Gather feedback from users and stakeholders, and iteratively improve the system based on their input. Continuously refine the AI model and make updates as needed to keep up with evolving legal, regulatory, and safeguarding requirements.
Looking for volunteers, especially related to GDPR and Safeguarding, all help welcome technical or otherwise!
