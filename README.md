### DocumentDarling



This project aims to take the pain out of creating and maintaining documents including legal, regulatory, safeguarding and many other forms and documents for organisationd, AI will (eventually!) regularly reviews documents suitability and the system automates the process to keep a human in the loop to approve changes, completed documents are always signed off by a human, an AI can alert the user to possible changes, and make suggestions as to what changes would meet the new requirements, it can also assist users not familiar with the system on where to place documents based on their content, and approve tone and content according to a master communications policy.

The idea was born of need for a system like this before we embarked on the EXAR-Wellbeing journey!

* Features: My project has the following features:
    * A Generic Folder Structure To Store Documents Logically.
    * A Document Tracker to indicite the documents stored, their location, status and extended details including the role title and user associated with the approval of that document.
    * An AI monitor can be connected to a document and provided sources for changes that would impact the documents accuracy over time.
    * On finding changes to requirements, the AI will notify the human as indicated by the Document Tracker.
    * Document filing assistant, will read an uploaded document and make suggestons as to where that should be filed.
    * Granular access to limit document read and write access to appropriate roles.

Sure, here is a possible way to group the roles for a team of 5 people, with one person good at comms, one tech, one admin, one can do anything and one can do just a little:


Comms: This person would be responsible for all communication with the team and with stakeholders. This could include writing emails, creating presentations, and giving speeches.

Tech: This person would be responsible for all technical aspects of the team's work. This could include setting up and maintaining the team's website, creating and managing databases, and developing software.

Admin: This person would be responsible for all administrative tasks for the team. This could include managing the team's budget, scheduling meetings, and ordering supplies.

Jack-of-all-trades: This person would be able to do a little bit of everything. They could help out with comms, tech, and admin tasks, as well as other tasks as needed.

Can-do: This person is willing to learn and help out with whatever is needed. They may not be an expert in any one area, but they are always willing to pitch in.

This is just one possible way to group the roles for a team of 5 people. The best way to group the roles will depend on the specific needs of the team and the tasks that need to be completed. However, by considering the skills and experience of the team members and the different tasks that need to be completed, you can create a team that is effective and efficient.
