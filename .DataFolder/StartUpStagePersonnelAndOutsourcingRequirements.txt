For a startup delivering Virtual Reality Therapy in the community, I would recommend the following complimentary roles for the team of 7:

1. Business Development Manager - to identify and pursue business opportunities, and to manage relationships with clients and partners.
2. Software Engineer - to design, develop, and maintain the software platform used for delivering the virtual reality therapy.
3. Marketing Specialist - to develop and implement marketing strategies and campaigns to promote the company's services.
4. Community Engagement Manager - to build and maintain relationships with community stakeholders, and to raise awareness of the benefits of virtual reality therapy.
5. Financial Analyst - to manage the company's finances, including budgeting and forecasting.
6. Compliance Manager - to ensure that the company is compliant with relevant regulations and requirements.
7. Outreach Manager - to manage outreach programs and community events to increase awareness and understanding of virtual reality therapy.

As a startup in the early stages, it is important to focus on the core functions of the business. Therefore, I would recommend outsourcing the following roles to external consultants or agencies:

1. Legal Counsel - to provide legal advice and support as needed.
2. Accounting - to manage bookkeeping and financial reporting.
3. Human Resources - to handle HR functions such as recruitment, onboarding, and employee benefits.
4. Graphic Design - to create marketing materials and designs for the company's website and app.

By outsourcing these functions, the startup can focus on developing and delivering high-quality virtual reality therapy services in the community, while leveraging the expertise of external consultants to manage other key aspects of the business.
